    "Modules in Ansible are discrete units of code that perform specific functions (ex. provision a storage account, restart a VM, copy a file...). Ansible modules can be run from the command line or as a task in an Ansible Playbook. \n",
    "- They are the basic building blocks of an Ansible Playbook\n",
    "- They are idempotent (i.e. any module run after the first will result in no change... think the 'Call Elevator' button)\n",
    "- There are both built-in modules (provided by Ansible) and custom modules (written by third parties... or you!)\n",
    "- Arguments can be passed into modules to affect how they function\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram showing the breakdown of a task in Ansible. Note that the task is comprised of exactly one Ansible Module. Module and Task variables are discussed further in the Variables section.\n",

    ">   - the source can be relative or absolute.  src will look under files directory in relative as well as local directory.\n",
    ">   - by default the copy module looks in the local directory and in the files subdirectory\n",
