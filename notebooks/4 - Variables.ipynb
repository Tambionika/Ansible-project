    "\n",
    "Variables in Ansible can be, and are, used in many different ways. This section aims to cover most of those ways and to offer insight into when and why they are used. But, fear not! Variables in Ansible are easy to use and understand, as we will come to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can define, reference and change your own variables\n",
    "- You can use any of the hundreds of variables that Ansible provides\n",
    "- Variables fall under different tiers of precedence, covered further at the end of this section\n",
    "- In most cases, the words 'fact' and 'variable ' are interchangeable in Ansible\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note:\n",
    "> - For the information below, refer to the picture under the Modules section\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Play Meta-Variables\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "connection: local\n",
    "```\n",
    "Specifies what connection type to use when accessing each individual host. eg. SSH, WinRM. `local` means to run on the current machine and not try and SSH into it\n",

    "gather_facts: false\n",
    "```\n",
    "Stops Ansible from gathering the built-in variables. Should be used iif you do not use any of the built in facts. Saves time.\n",

    "#### Module Variables\n",
