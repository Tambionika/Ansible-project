    "# Intro to Ansible\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible is an IT process automation tool that can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks. These can range from simply sending an email, to creating and configuring a server in the Cloud. At Chevron, Ansible is most often used for cloud resource deployment and configuration.\n",
    "- Ansible code is written in YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Playbook\n",
    "\n",
    "Playbooks in Ansible are sets of steps that define and automate different IT processes. As discussed above, these processes can range from very simple to highly complex. The steps taken inside Ansible Playbooks are called _tasks_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks are the individual steps that are taken when Ansible is run. In this way, an Ansible Playbook is a composition of tasks. Each task will run _exactly_ one Ansible Module (covered later). Below you can see an example of a task in Ansible.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` yaml\n",
    "# Blueprint\n",
    "- name: Name of the task\n",
    "  module_name:\n",

    "### Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a basic example to get an understanding of how Ansible can be used. Below is a standard bash command, `ls /home/cvx_admin_user/notebooks`, that will list the files in the `/home/cvx_admin_user/notebooks` directory. \n",
