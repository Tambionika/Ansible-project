    "Roles in Ansible are tasks that are grouped together to allow for code (i.e. task) reuse. These roles are repositories of code that serve specific and often isolated purposes. For example, you may write a role to provision a VM or a role to perform a backup of VM disks. If you'd like, you can think of roles in Ansible like functions in other languages: something you can call over and over again that will perform a specific set of tasks and you alter the output or outcome just by the adjusting the input variables.\n",

    "An Ansible Role is a repo that, while not held to a strict construction standard, will often follow a similar structure regardless of the purpose it serves. At Chevron, an Ansible Role will almost always have the following structure:\n",
